# Energy Consumption Monitoring and Optimization

## Project Overview

This project aims to monitor and optimize energy consumption using a combination of modern data engineering technologies including Kafka, PySpark, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Apache Airflow, and FastAPI. The system processes and analyzes energy usage data to improve efficiency and reduce costs for utility companies.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](path_to_architecture_diagram_image)

### Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - **PostgreSQL**: Stores raw energy usage data.
   - **Kafka**: Streams data from PostgreSQL.

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - **PySpark**: Processes and analyzes data, performs transformations, and optimizations.

3. **Storage Layer**
   - **Snowflake**: Stores processed data for historical analysis.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Stores real-time monitoring data.

4. **Orchestration Layer**
   - **Apache Airflow**: Schedules and manages ETL workflows.

5. **API Layer**
   - **FastAPI**: Provides real-time energy monitoring and optimization suggestions.

### Data Flow

1. **PostgreSQL to Kafka**
   - Data is streamed from PostgreSQL to Kafka.

2. **Kafka to PySpark**
   - PySpark reads data from Kafka for processing and analysis.

3. **PySpark to Snowflake**
   - Processed data is written to Snowflake for historical analysis.

4. **PySpark to PostgreSQL**
   - Real-time processed data is written to PostgreSQL for monitoring.

5. **Airflow Managing PySpark Jobs**
   - Airflow schedules and manages the PySpark ETL workflows.

6. **FastAPI Interacting with PostgreSQL**
   - FastAPI retrieves data from PostgreSQL to provide real-time monitoring and optimization suggestions.
